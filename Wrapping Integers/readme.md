This code demonstrates what **"Wrapping Around an Integer"** means or what happens when an integer wraps around. In other words, the code shows what the compiler does when an integer variable runs out of its dedicated memory space.

The **wrap.cpp** file can be directly opened by any compiler or IDE. However, the whole project file (**Wrapping Integers.cbp**) was created by Code::Blocks v20.03.
